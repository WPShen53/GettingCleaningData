## Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file to the subdirectory \UCI HAR Dataset.
3. run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [w4_tidy_avg_dataset.txt](w4_tidy_avg_dataset.csv).**
